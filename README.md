# SQL Class Assignment Repository

Welcome to my SQL class assignment repository! This repository contains assignments related to my SQL course. The assignments are divided into two parts: Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.

## Assignment 1 (Day 15 - 4th Meeting)

**INSTRUCTION**
- For number 1, please refer to the pict on the learning platform.
- For number 2-8, please use the "employees" and "salaries" table.

Here are the questions and tasks:

1. Created a table based on specific conditions and constraints.
2. Corrected an incorrect hire date for an employee named Kyoichi.

6. Calculate the total amount of salary to be paid to employees in March.
7. Retrieved the highest salary information for each employee.
8. Counted how many times each employee received a salary greater than 4,500,000 from January to March.

## Assignment 2 (Day 30 - 8th Meeting)

**INSTRUCTION**
- For number 1-3, please use the "data_kelas" database.
- For number 2-8, please use the "3_odds" database.

Here are the questions and tasks:

1. Display employee information (employee_id, employee_name, branch_name, total_sales) whose total_sales is more than Rp. 10,000,000. Sort by column total_sales from smallest to largest.
2. Present information about the number of employees handled by each manager.
3. Present the highest sales information that was successfully carried out by each branch.
4. Create a query to get information about the names of employees who handle more than 7 customers.
5. Using CTEs. Make a query to get the number of employees from every country other than America.
6. Create a stored function to get the customer's continent of origin based on the country information. For example, if the name of the country is USA then the continent is America.
7. Create a stored function to categorize the average price of goods (priceEach). If the price of the item is above 100 then it is included in the High price category, otherwise it is included in the low-price category.
8. Create a stored function that can categorize customers based on their credit limit. If the credit limit is more than 50000 then it is included in the PLATINUM category, if it is in the range of 10000 to 50000 then it is in the GOLD category, and below 10000, it is entered in the SILVER category. Using the function that has been created, display customer segmentation information in the customers' table.

Feel free to explore the assignments and their solutions.

Happy coding!
